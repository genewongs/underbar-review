# underbar-review
### Objective 
To familiarize myself and build upon my Javascript fundementals, Underbar tasked me to implement underscore higher order functions from scratch.
I learned a lot on what happens under the hood in some native javascript higher order functions like reduce, map, sort, some, every.... And even some more advanced higher order functions offered in Underscore like memoize. 

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.
